LIST:
a list is a built-in dynamic sized array (automatically grows and shrinks).
We can store all types of items (including another list) in a list.
A list may contain mixed type of items, this is possible because a list mainly stores
references at contiguous locations and actual items maybe stored at different locations.

DICTIONARY:
A Python dictionary is a data structure that stores the value in key: value pairs.
Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys
canâ€™t be repeated and must be immutable.

TUPLES:
Python Tuple is a collection of objects separated by commas. A tuple is similar
to a Python list in terms of indexing, nested objects, and repetition but the
main difference between both is Python tuple is immutable, unlike the Python list
which is mutable.
