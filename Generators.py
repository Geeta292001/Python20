#GENERATORS:
#         Generators are a way to create iterators in Python using functions and the yield keyword.
#         They allow you to generate values one at a time as needed, rather than computing and storing all values in memory upfront.
#
# ADVANTAGES:
#
#         Memory Efficient:
#                        They donâ€™t store the entire sequence in memory; instead, they yield items one at a time.
#         Lazy Evaluation:
#                        Values are computed only when needed, which can improve performance for large datasets.
#         Readable Code:
#                        Simplifies implementation of iterators.
#
#
# DISADVANTAGES:
#
#         Single Iteration:
#                 Generators can only be iterated once. To re-iterate, you need to create a new generator.
#         Debugging:
#                 Difficult to debug as the state is not stored explicitly.
#         Limited Access:
#                 Cannot access elements by index or use slicing.



# USE CASES:
#         Reading large files line by line.
#         Generating infinite sequences (e.g., Fibonacci numbers).
#         Streaming data processing.
