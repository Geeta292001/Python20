# LIST :
#        A list is a mutable, and allow dupicate elements.
#        It is a ordered collection of elements that can store items of different data types.
#        It is defined by square
#        EXAMPLE:
#               [1,2,20.12,"Apple",66.44]
#
#
# ADVANTAGES OF LIST:
#
#      Versatility
#               They can store heterogeneous data types  (sring,interger,etc.)
#      Dynamic Size
#               List can grow shrink dynamically without requring a fixed size.
#
# DISADVANTAGES OF LIST:
#
#     Memory Overhead
#               Lists consume more memory as they store additional metadata like type inforamtion and size.
#     Slower for some operation
#               Accessing and modifying elements can be slower compared to arrays in other languages due to dynamic typing.
#
#     EXAMPLES:

# # Create a list of mixed data types
#my_list = [10, "Python", 3.14, True]

# # Access elements using indexing
#print(my_list[0])  # Output: 10
#print(my_list[-1]) # Output: True



# # Create a list of numbers
# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#
# # Add an element to the list
# numbers.append(6)  # List becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#
# # Remove an element
# numbers.remove(3)  # List becomes [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
#
# # Sort the list
# numbers.sort()  # List becomes [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
#
# print(numbers)
